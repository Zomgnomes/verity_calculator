# Verity Calculator
A Calculator for the Verity encounter of Destiny 2's Salvation's Edge Raid

## Directions
Download the html file and open it in the web-browser of your choice.
Enter the data it asks for and it will fill in the output section for you.

The output will tell you what shape:
- Circle (C)
- Square (S)
- Triangle (T)

To put where:
- Left (L)
- Middle (M)
- Right (R)

And is broken up into what wave of Knights you're on (1st or 2nd).

For example:
If your inside guardians are square on the left, triangle in the middle, and circle on the right. (S-T-C)
And your outside shapes are prism on the left, cone in the middle, and cylinder on the right (ST-CT-CS)
Then your output will be:
1. SL - TM - CR
2. TL

Which means on the first wave of knights, you will want to bank a square on the left statue, followed by a triangle on the middle statue, followed by a circle on the right statue.

On the next wave, you only need to bank a triangle on the left statue and your dissection phase will be complete.

There's helper buttons for copying the wave so you can paste it into in game chat and resetting to make things a bit quicker to operate while raiding.
